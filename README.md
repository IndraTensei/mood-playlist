## 💡 Pro Tips

- **Combine with Spotify URI**: Copy the track URLs from the output and open them directly in the Spotify app
- **Save credentials once**: Use `--save-config` to store your Spotify keys — no more typing them every time!
- **Discover new combos**: Try mood blends like `energetic+coding` for a hyper-focus playlist, or `angry+zen` for... interesting contrast 😅
- **Surprise yourself**: Can't decide? `--surprise` picks a mood and might introduce you to your next favorite vibe
- **Shell aliases**: Add to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` for quick access:
  ```bash
  alias vibes="mood-playlist --interactive"
  alias jams="mood-playlist energetic --export-json -o ~/playlists/"
  alias mood="mood-playlist --surprise"
  ```
- **Script it**: Pipe the JSON export into your own tools:
  ```bash
  mood-playlist coding --export-json | jq '.tracks[] | .spotify_url'
  ```
